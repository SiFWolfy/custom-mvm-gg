Tindall' Overclocks for Galvanized Gauntlet

At the time of writing this, the following Overclocks were only used in the following missions.
• Akure - Bronze and Bristle (Intermediate)
• Akure - Gold And Grit (Advanced)
• Akure - Diamond And Dross (Expert)

Notes:
Yes, they cost 0$ similar to Cactus' Overclocks, but your currency can't be negative.
and you may need to refund or prepurchase your upgrades for them to take effect.
(I will not take account for any side effect of attributes stacking that may break the balance further.)

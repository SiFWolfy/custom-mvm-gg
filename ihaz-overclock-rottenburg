	ihaz's Scout Custom Upgrade List

At the time of writing this, these weapons were seen in..
• Rottenburg - Marathon (Easy Adv)

The goal of this list is to be as honest and objective as possible.

Notes:
While this mission is relatively easy, I do think at least it attempted to try to be unique.
Most of the custom upgrades were also quite creative.

Custom Weapon
//===============
Primary
//===============

// NOT SEEN on RELEASE
  • Debug Shotgun (Rottenburg) 
// hope you can understand my poor english
-- ok,,, :<
-- This weapon is no longer accessible, but according to demo its just some kind of 
-- perma DMG boost and insane crit. Whatever, I guess.

  • Super Shotgun V1 (Rottenburg) 
  • Super Shotgun V2 (Rottenburg) 
-- Quite strong on early game, but fell off compared to soda popper and shortstop mid-game.
-- It appears that the only diff /w v1 and v2, are how the damage scales, for the trade of being innacurate.
-- Shame, ig. But it does what its designed for. I won't list that dupe here.

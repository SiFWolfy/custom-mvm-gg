This page is intended to list every single stat change that SiF did in an attempt
to make useless weapon slightly more bearable in a sense. 

Or give said weapon some sort of quirk or rework so they are AT LEAST usable in said mission.

While this was written, it was originally going to be available in the following missions;
• Production - (Unnamed) (Advanced)
• Silentsky - Frigid Citadel (Advanced)
• Cyberia - (???) (Adv - Endu)

Currently they are only avaiable past wave 2 in Production Adv.

Doc version with colour codes could be found here.

Lyney' Demo Custom Weps List.

At the time of writing this, these weapons were seen in..
• Coldtown - 6 Scottish Pentathlon (Easy Adv)

The goal of this list is to be as honest and objective as possible.

Notes:
This mission were generally mediocre and borderline underwhelming
to the point where I never really bothered to test for any refund bugs that may not be mentioned here.
